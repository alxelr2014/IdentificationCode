\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor at the Institute for Communications Engineering of the TUM Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering M.Sc Mohammad Salariseddigh for his support, patience , enthusiasm and the immense knowledge I was able to acquire thanks to him. Although I came across some difficulties dealing with a variety of problems I had to solve during this work, his guidance, motivation and constructive feedback  helped me throughout this challenging work and enabled me to surpass my capacities.
My bachelor thesis at the Institute for Communications Engineering was a great opportunity to go through the world of information theory and learn how to make communications efficient, reliable and secure.
Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my family and friends for providing me with unconditional support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of studies and through the process of researching and writing this thesis and their help to across the difficult moments during the pandemic (Covid-19). This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.
