abstract = {It is proved that the Shannon zero-error capacity of the pentagon is sqrt{5} . The method is then generalized to obtain upper bounds on the capacity of an arbitrary graph. A well-characterized, and in a sense easily computable, function is introduced which bounds the capacity from above and equals the capacity in a large number of cases. Several results are obtained on the capacity of special graphs; for example, the Petersen graph has capacity four and a self-complementary graph with n points and with a vertex-transitive automorphism group has capacity sqrt{5} .},

The algorithm is based on semi-definite programming, some properties of the Lov{\'a}szϑ-function of a graph and the recent algorithm of Karger, Motwani and Sudan for approximating the chromatic number of a graph. If theϑ-function of ann vertex graph is at leastMn1−2/kfor some absolute constantM, we describe another, related, efficient algorithm that finds an independent set of sizek. Several examples show the limitations of the approach and the analysis together with some related arguments supply new results on the problem of estimating the largest possible ratio between theϑ-function and the independence number of a graph onn vertices. {\textcopyright} 1998 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.

It includes in-depth coverage of the mathematics of reliable information transmission, both in two-terminal and multi-terminal network scenarios. Updated and considerably expanded, this new edition presents unique discussions of information theoretic secrecy and of zero-error information theory, including the deep connections of the latter with extremal combinatorics. The presentations of all core subjects are self contained, even the advanced topics, which helps readers to understand the important connections between seemingly different problems. Finally, 320 end-of-chapter problems, together with helpful solving hints, allow readers to develop a full command of the mathematical techniques. It is an ideal resource for graduate students and researchers in electrical and electronic engineering, computer science and applied mathematics.",

First, a refinement of the argument based on “random” coding will be used to obtain an upper bound on the probability of error for an optimal code in the memoryless finite discrete channel. Next, an equation is obtained for the capacity of a finite state channel when the state can be calculated at both transmitting and receiving terminals. An analysis is also made of the more complex case where the state is calculable at the transmitting point but not necessarily at the receiving point."

abstract="Consider a device that wants to communicate with another device (for instance a contactless one). We focus on how to withstand privacy threats in such a situation, and we here describe how to query the device and then identify it, with a new identification protocol solution. The interrogation step uses the concept of identification codes introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. We show that this probabilistic coding scheme indeed protects the device against an eavesdropper who wants to track it. In particular, when using a special class of identification codes due to Moulin and Koetter that are based on Reed-Solomon codes, we directly depend on the hardness of a cryptographic assumption known as the Polynomial Reconstruction problem. We analyse the security and privacy properties of our proposal in the privacy model for contactless devices introduced by Vaudenay at ASIACRYPT 2007. We finally explain how to apply our scheme with very low-cost devices.",
