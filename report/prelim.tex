\section{Preliminaries}
\subsection{Notation}
Suppose \(\mathcal{D}\) is a distribution over the set \(S\), by \(x \gets \mathcal{D}\) we mean that \(x\) is chosen from the set \(S\) according to the distribution \(\mathcal{D}\). When \(x\) is chosen uniformly we simply denote it as \(x \gets S\).

We describe the asymptotic behavior of functions by several notations. The \textit{big O} notation \(\bigO{\cdot}\) is used o bound the growth of a function in terms of another function. For example, we write \(\func{f}{x} = \bigO{\func{g}{x}}\) if there exists a constant \(C > 0\) such that for sufficiently large \(x\), \(\abs{\func{f}{x}} \leq C\func{g}{x}\). We denote \(f \sim g\) when \(f\) and \(g\) are asymptotically the same, that is 
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{x\to \infty} \dfrac{\func{f}{x}}{\func{g}{x}} = 1.
\end{equation}
